An breathtaking, museum-quality digital art masterpiece depicting the concept of AI-powered image generation as a surreal, dreamlike landscape. At the center, a magnificent, oversized golden banana hovers majestically in a vast digital sky, its surface covered in an intricate pattern of circuit boards and flowing data streams that shimmer with iridescent colors. The banana is partially unpeeled, revealing a glowing core of swirling AI neural networks rendered in stunning detail with thousands of interconnected nodes pulsing with light in Google's signature color palette. Surrounding the banana is a spiral galaxy of generated images - each one a miniature masterpiece showing different subjects - portraits, landscapes, abstract art - all flowing in an elegant helix pattern. The text "NANO BANANA" appears in an spectacular, three-dimensional typography that seems carved from pure light, with each letter casting realistic shadows and reflections. Below it, "The Future of AI Image Generation" is rendered in an elegant, flowing script that integrates seamlessly with the composition. In the foreground, create a sophisticated holographic interface showing multiple CLI terminal windows, each displaying different stages of image generation, with progress bars and technical readouts rendered in stunning detail. The color scheme masterfully blends Google's vibrant primaries with Anthropic's sophisticated purples and deep blues, creating a harmonious gradient that flows throughout the entire composition. Add floating geometric shapes - cubes, spheres, and polyhedrons - each displaying different aspects of the image generation process, connected by glowing lines of light. Include the Google Gemini constellation and Anthropic's brand elements as elegant, three-dimensional holographic projections integrated naturally into the scene. The overall style should evoke the best of contemporary digital art, combining elements of Alex Grey's visionary art, Beeple's futuristic aesthetics, and Apple's product photography sophistication. Perfect composition following the golden ratio, dramatic cinematic lighting with multiple light sources, volumetric fog effects, professional color grading, ultra-high definition detail, frame-worthy artistic quality that could be featured in a modern art museum's digital art exhibition.
