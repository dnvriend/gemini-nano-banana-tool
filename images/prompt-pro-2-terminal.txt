A hyper-detailed, cyberpunk-inspired visualization of a next-generation terminal interface with depth and dimensionality. The central focus is a holographic-style 3D terminal window floating in space, displaying beautifully rendered, syntax-highlighted code with the command "gemini-nano-banana-tool generate --model pro". The banana emoji 🍌 serves as an animated, glowing command prompt. The terminal has a sophisticated dark theme with frosted glass transparency effects, showing layers of AI processing visualization behind it. Display the text "GEMINI CLI" in large, bold, futuristic typography with a subtle neon glow effect and perfect anti-aliasing. Below, show "Built for Claude Code & AI Agents" in premium monospace font with letter-spacing that suggests precision engineering. Create an elaborate background featuring a 3D visualization of neural pathways rendered as flowing, luminescent tubes in Google's signature colors (blue, red, yellow, green), interconnecting with nodes that pulse with Anthropic's purple light. Add floating holographic windows showing thumbnail previews of AI-generated images. Include technical UI elements like progress bars, metrics displays, and code snippets that appear to be rendering in real-time. Integrate both company logos as subtle holographic watermarks. The style should evoke high-end developer tools from science fiction, combining the aesthetics of Blade Runner, Minority Report interfaces, and modern MacOS design principles. Perfect lighting with volumetric effects, ultra-sharp text rendering, professional motion graphics freeze-frame quality, cinematic composition with dramatic depth of field.
