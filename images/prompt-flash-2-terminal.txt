A sleek terminal-inspired composition showing a dark-themed CLI interface with a banana emoji 🍌 as the command prompt icon. The terminal displays syntax-highlighted command text in green and yellow colors against a dark navy blue background. Show a command line that reads "$ gemini-nano-banana-tool generate" with the cursor blinking. In the background, create an abstract visualization of AI neural networks with flowing lines connecting nodes, rendered in Google's signature colors (blue, red, yellow, green) with a subtle glow. Add the text "CLI" in large, bold monospace font at the top, and "Powered by Gemini & Claude Code" in smaller text at the bottom. Include subtle references to both Google and Anthropic branding through color choices. The style should be modern developer tool aesthetic, cyberpunk-lite, professional software interface design, sharp and clean with good contrast.
